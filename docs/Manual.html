</div>


<div id="metidtracker-user-manual" class="section level1">
<h1>MetIDTracker User Manual</h1>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>MetIDTracker is intended to be used as a tool for collaborative annotation of LC-MS/MSMS data. It is developed to improve the identification confidence in untargeted metabolomics experiments but may also be used to annotate other kinds of MS/MSMS data.</p>
<p>The system includes two components - the software with graphic user interface and the database. The database serves as a repository for reference data (compound database, MSMS libraries, etc.), experimental results (MS and MSMS spectra), and metadata (sample description, experimental conditions, instrument methods, etc.). Multiple users may access the same database and collaborate on the annotation of spectra.</p>
</div>
<div id="basic-operations" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic operations</h2>
<p>It is highly recommended to run the software on a computer with at least 16GB RAM and to use a large high-resolution monitor (24” or more).</p>
<div id="staring-the-program" class="section level3">
<h3>Staring the program</h3>
<p>To start MetIDTracker double-click StartMetIDTracker.bat file inside the MetIDTracker… folder. Software distribution includes its own version of Java runtime, so it doesn’t matter if you have Java installed on your computer or not. By default, maximum RAM allocation for the program is set to 8GB. If your computer has RAM smaller than 12GB you may want to reduce memory allocation to MetIDTracker by editing HEAP_SIZE variable in the StartMetIDTracker.bat file before starting the program. The software was not tested with memory allocation of less than 4GB, however.</p>
<div id="establishing-connection-between-metidtracker-and-database" class="section level4">
<h4>Establishing connection between MetIDTracker and database</h4>
<p>During program startup it will try to establish connection with the database using the settings from preferences. If this fails (e.g. during the first time you run the program, when database location and credentials were not provided yet), Database connection setup dialog is displayed (21).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.001.png" /></p>
<p>2.1 <em>Database connection setup dialog</em></p>
<p>Edit host name, port, user, and password fields to match the parameters of your database configuration (SID/database and schema are determined by the database dump you’ve used at the previous steps and should not be changed). Click “Test connection” (22) button to verify that database connection can be established using the parameters in the form. Click “Continue program startup” to save the connection parameters and launch the program.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.002.png" /></p>
<p>2.2 <em>Testing database connection parameters</em></p>
<p>Database connection parameters are stored in program preferences and unless the database can not be accessed (because it is down or there are network issues) or access credentials are changed, the connection will be established automatically, and Database connection setup dialog will not be shown.</p>
<p>While the program is starting up it will display the splash screen with the program version and build date ().</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.003.png" /></p>
<p>2.3 <em>Startup splash screen</em></p>
<p>Current startup operation is displayed in blue at the bottom of the splash screen “Initializing user interface” stage may take some time (half a minute or more, depending on the available CPU resources and RAM).</p>
</div>
<div id="logging-into-the-database" class="section level4">
<h4>Logging into the database</h4>
<p>MetIDTracker is a collaborative environment, and each user must provide his/her personal credentials to access and annotate the data. In the fresh installation there is a single user in the database with username “admin” and password “admin” (no quotations). Admin user may create other users with administrative or regular access, and it is recommended to change the admin password during the first program run.</p>
<p>To log into the system, click the <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.004.png" /> icon on the right side of the main toolbar. The login dialog is displayed (24). Provide the credentials (e.g. admin/admin at first connection) and click “Log in” button.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.005.png" /></p>
<p>2.4 <em>IDTracker login dialog</em></p>
<p>If you log in as a user with administrative privileges, <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.004.png" /> icon is replaced by <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.004.png" /> (superuser), otherwise it is replaced by the icon for regular user (<img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.004.png" />). To log out click on the user icon.</p>
<p>To change the password, click “Change password”, fill all the information in the dialog (25) and click “Change password” button to confirm the change. Enter new password in the login dialog and click “Log in”.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.006.png" /></p>
<p>5.5 <em>Change password dialog</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="managing-system-users" class="section level3">
<h3>Managing system users</h3>
<p>If you log in as a user with administrative privileges, you will be able to access the User Manager Dialog (26). To display it, click the <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.004.png" /> icon on the right side of the main toolbar. Use icons on the panel toolbar to create, edit or delete the users. “Create User” and “Edit User” dialogs (27) are identical, except “Edit User” dialog is pre-populated with the data for user selected in the User Manager. All fields must be populated with data. Every user has to be associate with organization (see the section below).</p>

<p>7.7 <em>User editor dialog</em></p>
</div>
<div id="managing-organizations" class="section level3">
<h3>Managing organizations</h3>
<p>MetIDTracker is developed as a part of a larger software package adapted to the needs of the service lab, so the underlying database requires some additional structured information about the users. Organization Manager (28), available for users with administrative access, allows users to add or edit this information.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.009.png" /></p>
<p>8.8 <em>Organization Manager</em></p>
<p>To call the Organization Manager click on the <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.004.png" /> icon next to the User Manager icon on the main toolbar.</p>
<p>“Add New Organization” and “Edit Organization” dialogs (29) are identical, except the “Edit Organization” dialog is pre-populated with the data for organization selected in the Organization Manager. All fields must be populated with data.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.010.png" /></p>

<div id="general-notes-about-graphical-user-interface" class="section level3">
<h3>General notes about Graphical User Interface</h3>
<div id="rearranging-panels" class="section level4">
<h4>Rearranging panels</h4>
<p>The user interface is based on DockingFrames library (www.docking-frames.org). It allows for flexible customization of the working area based on user preferences, preserving the layout between the sessions, and using more than one computer monitor for data analysis.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.011.png" /></p>
<p>10.10 <em>Panel controls</em></p>
<p>Panel controls used in the new GUI are shown on 210. The horizontal bar (1) allows to minimize any panel to a small bar with icon, panel name and “restore” button (4). The corner button (2) allows to toggle the panel between its current size maximized within its parent panel. The detach/attach button (3) is present only on major panels (“IDTracker workbench”, “IDTracker LIMS”, “Raw data examiner”, “Databases”). It allows the user to use the whole panel as a separate program window that may be moved to the second monitor.</p>
<p>All major panels may be rearranged inside the main program window and all smaller panels inside each of the major panels may also be rearranged according to user preferences. Moving the panel is achieved by clicking on its title tab (5) and dragging it to the desired location. Legitimate locations are highlighted by the blue frame and panel will snap to the new position when you release the mouse button (211).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.012.png" /></p>
<p>11.11 <em>Switching between side-by-side and overlay layouts and back using drag and drop</em></p>
<p>Layout of all program windows is preservedd between sessions (program will re-open with the layout it when last closed). User may show/hide major program panels using “Panels” menu (212).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.013.png" /></p>
<p>12.12 <em>Program panels menu</em></p>
</div>
<div id="progress-dialog" class="section level4">
<h4>Progress dialog</h4>
<p>The progress dialog serves several purposes: it allows the user to monitor the execution of long tasks (database search, library search, etc.), it prevents the user from interacting with the program when the tasks that require heavy computations are running, and it allows the user to interrupt the long running tasks if necessary using commands from the context menu (213). Maximal allowed number of concurrent running tasks is defined in the general preferences.</p>

<h2>MetIDTracker LIMS system</h2>
<p>LIMS stands for Laboratory Information Management System. Its purpose is to provide a database back end and friendly user interface for managing multiple kinds of data associated with MSMS experiments.</p>
<div id="projects-and-experiments" class="section level3">
<h3>Projects and experiments</h3>
<div id="project-configuration" class="section level4">
<h4>Project configuration</h4>
<p>Projects allow the grouping of related identification experiments. Every experiment has to be associated with the project. To create the new project, click the <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.004.png" /> icon on the IDTracker LIMS panel toolbar to display the Project Editor Dialog (31).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.015.png" /></p>
<p>1.1 <em>Project Editor Dialog</em></p>
<p>The name is obligatory, description and notes are optional, Project ID, start date and laboratory are populated automatically based on the currently logged in user data.</p>
<p>To edit project information, select it in the tree, right-click and choose “Show Edit compound identification project” from the popup menu (32).</p>

<p>2.2 <em>Project context menu</em></p>
</div>
<div id="experiment-configuration" class="section level4">
<h4>Experiment configuration</h4>
<p>The easiest and least error-prone way to create an experiment and load data in is by using the wizard (see below). Different steps for unguided experiment definition and data upload will be added to the manual later since this part of the software still needs some refinement.</p>
<p>To edit some basic experiment information, select the experiment in the tree, right-click and choose “Show Edit compound identification project” from the popup menu (33) to show Experiment Editor Dialog (34).</p>

<h2>iDDA data upload Wizard</h2>
<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This section of the manual is walking through the process of uploading MSMS data. At the moment, only MSMS data generated by Agilent instruments and extracted into Agilent CEF format are supported. The data used as example in this manual were obtained by iterative data-dependent MSMS acquisition (iDDA) using one sample, but the same process can be applied to upload MSMS data for multiple distinct samples.</p>
<p>This manual covers the process of creating a new experiment and uploading MSMS data using the wizard. Data upload is a complex multistep process. The goal of the wizard is to ensure that all the necessary information is collected and checked for errors and integrity before it is entered into the database. The wizard guides the process through the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating experiment</li>
<li>Adding samples</li>
<li>Adding sample preparation data</li>
<li>Adding data acquisition and data analysis methods</li>
<li>Adding instrument worklists</li>
<li>Verification of MS/MSMS data</li>
<li>Uploading of all collected data to the database</li>
</ul>
<p>Each step must be completed and verified before the data can be entered at the next step and all steps must be completed and free of errors to complete the data upload. The wizard is intended to create a NEW experiment and upload the MSMS data for it. If you want to add the data to an existing experiment you will have to use individual tools on the “IDTracker LIMS” tab.</p>
</div>
<div id="wizard-guided-workflow" class="section level3">
<h3>Wizard-guided workflow</h3>
<p>Start MRC2 data analysis software and switch to “IDTracker LIMS” tab. Login into ID tracker by clicking <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.034.png" /> icon on the right side of the main software toolbar and entering your METLims or ID tracker username and password in the dialog. If login is successful, the system will fetch the current data from the database to populate the different tables and the login icon will change to <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.035.png" /> followed by your name. To open the wizard dialog (43), click on the <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.036.png" /> icon on the “ID tracker LIMS” tab toolbar. The wizard toolbar contains the buttons that correspond to individual data preparation steps (41).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.037.png" /></p>
<p>1.1 <em>Wizard toolbar</em></p>
<p>Clicking on each button loads the corresponding wizard page in the main area of the dialog. The active stage is indicated by the red border around the icon. The user may switch between the screens at any point in the process, but some of the screens may not allow data to be enteredunless previous steps are completed. Each wizard screen has a “Complete ‘…Step name…’” button in the lower right corner (42) that users must click to verify the entered information and proceed to the next step if there are no errors:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.038.png" /></p>
<p>2.2 <em>Complete step button</em></p>

</div>
<div id="adding-samples-to-the-experiment" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding samples to the experiment</h3>
<p>At this stage you must add one or more samples (aliquots) to the experiment. MSMS is performed either on aliquots of samples prepared specifically for this purpose (like MoTrPAC reference tissue types, CHEAR plasma urine, etc.) or pooled samples from MRC2 client experiments. For this reason, ID Tracker samples are handled differently than regular LIMS samples using a two-tier system that includes stock samples and aliquots created from them. Stock samples hold the information about the origin of the sample (tissue type, species, LIMS experiment if available), aliquot references the stock sample for this information and represents a small portion of the stock sample prepared for the specific compound identification experiment.</p>
<p>You may add new aliquots either based on existing stock samples or create new stock samples and then add aliquots based on them.</p>
<div id="create-the-aliquot-from-existing-stock-sample" class="section level4">

<h3>Adding instrument worklist data</h3>
<p>Worklist data (raw data file names, acquisition methods, file names, etc.) are obtained by scanning the directories containing raw data the same way they are scanned to collect acquisition method data. Directory scans are not recursive, so if there is more than one directory with raw data files from the current experiment (e.g. positive and negative mode) they all should be scanned individually. During the scan acquisition method for each data file is checked against the list defined at the previous step. When directory scan is completed information for all data files is entered into the table (419). If any of the detected acquisition methods was not previously added to the experiment the user is given a choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>ignore raw data files that are using the missing methods</li>
<li>cancel worklist import, return to methods screen, and add the missing methods</li>

To add more data files to the list, use the <img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.057.png" /> icon. Duplicate files will be ignored, so there is no possibility of entering duplicate data by accidentally scanning the same folder more than once.</p>
<p>To complete the worklist import step it is necessary to assign samples to data files. To do that select all the files in the table that correspond to the same sample, right click to show the context menu, and select “Edit design for selected samples” (419).

The time depends on the number of files and the number of features in each file. If any new library entries will be uploaded to the MSMS database during the pre-scan of the data and/or if any of the compound IDs can’t be matched to the compound database this information will be displayed in the “Data prescan details” dialog. Unmatched compound IDs will prevent the correct data upload, so if they are present, please copy the log and use it to edit/extend compound database (//<strong>TODO</strong> needs section in the manual).

<h3>ID certainty levels</h3>
<p>ID certainty levels are for internal use and do not have any direct relation to established ID confidence levels specified by different metabolomics consortia. Levels are color-coded for easier visualization, colors are user-specified. The values are assigned not to the feature, but to its default identification. If there is a default ID, the info will be shown both in the feature table and in the identifications table.

<h3>Standard annotations</h3>
<p>Standard forms of annotation (ID level and follow-up steps) can be applied only to the identified features since they are associated with feature ID but not with the feature itself. Unknown features may be annotated by typing in free form comments, but it is time consuming and more difficult to search and summarize later. For this reason, MetIDTracker includes an option to add “Standard annotations” to any feature regardless of identification status. It works the same way as “Follow-up” steps.

<h2>Searching MSMS libraries</h2>
<p>MetIDTracker allows users to search the experimental features against MSMS libraries using NIST MSPepSearch.</p>
<p>The software is available <a href="https://chemdata.nist.gov/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=peptidew:mspepsearch">here</a> Please use “Current release (02/22/2019, with new hybrid and hi-res searches, no GUI)”. MSPepSearch doesn’t require installation, just unpack the archive in your preferred location on the disk and set the location of the executable in MetIDTracker preferences.</p>
<p>MSMS libraries have to be modified and formatted in a specific way so that the search results may be uploaded to the MetIDTracker database and properly linked to the library entries and compound information. Several libraries ready to use with MetIDTracker are provided for download <a href="https://github.com/araskind/MRC2Toolbox#msms-libraries">here</a>:</p>

<h4>Input data and libraries</h4>
<p>“Input data and libraries” (448) is used to specify the source of experimental MSMS spectra and the set of MSMS libraries to use in the search. “Internal” input means that the set or subset of MSMS features currently active in MetIDTracker will be searched against the specified libraries. The subset of features is determined by the option selected in the “For internal data” dropdown menu. “All” means all features in the currently active feature collection. “Filtered” means all features visible in the MSMS feature table (relevant when at least one data filter is applied to the table). “Selected only” - only features selected in the table will be used. Selected subset of features will be written out in NIST MSP format to the MetIDTracker directory. If the “File” input data source is selected, use the “Browse” button to select the MSP input file.</p>
<p>Use the Add/Remove library buttons to manage the list of libraries. Libraries should be in NIST format. Libraries that were not properly integrated with MetIDTracker still can be searched, but results cannot be uploaded. The MSPepSearch output file will be written out to MetIDTracker directory.</p>

Then you must add at least one neutral loss or neutral adduct (repeat) using the corresponding buttons. For the cases when there is more than one loss or repeat of the same kind you will have to add each modification separately. The name for a new adduct will be created automatically based on the names of the building blocks, but you may add your own description if necessary.</p>
<p>To edit an adduct select it in the adduct manager table and click the “Edit adduct” button on the toolbar. Depending on the type of adduct (simple or composite) the appropriate dialog will show pre-populated with the data for selected adduct.</p>

<p>By default, precursor M/Z for MSMS feature and default adduct for charge will be selected in the adducts table. If the feature was previously identified and assigned a different adduct, it will be selected in the table instead. To look up the compounds in the database by neutral mass based on M/Z and selected adduct click the “Search” button under the adducts table. You may use other fields in the search form to narrow down the search. The fields are additive (the more different search parameters you specify the more filters are applied to search results). You may exclude searching by mass altogether by clearing the mass field. After the search is completed you may select one of the entries in the “Database search results” table and click the “Assign selected identification” button to set it as a default identity for the selected feature. The adduct selected in the adducts table will be also assigned as default.</p>

<li>Convert original instrument raw data files to mzml and put the converted files into the repository</li>
</ul>
<p>When raw data files are opened, TIC is extracted automatically</p>
<p>To use the raw data conversion you will need to specify the location of msconvert.exe file in the preferences (see picture above). Msconvert is part of the ProteoWizard package and may be downloaded <a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/download.html">here</a></p>

<p>To extract chromatograms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select data files in the table</li>
<li>Choose chromatogram type (TIC, BPC or extracted ion)</li>
<li>Choose MS level</li>
<li>Specify m/z window for XIC extraction</li>
<li>Change polarity if necessary (not automated yet)</li>
<li>For XIC type in one or more m/z values separated by comma, check “Sum all” if you want cumulative XIC, otherwise separate XICs will be extracted for each mass.</li>
<li>If you want to limit RT range, specify lower and upper limits and check “Limit RT range” checkbox</li>
<li>Click “Extract chromatograms”</li>
</ul>
<p>All settings except data file selection are preserved across sessions.</p>

<p>The two buttons on the tracker workbench toolbar marked in red above are related to the raw data repository. The first is used to index/re-index the raw data files. This will be necessary only if you manually add raw data files to the repository.</p>
<p>Clicking the second button will tell the program to try loading the raw data files for all of the features currently in the MS2 features table. This can be done only if the raw data repository location is correctly defined in the preferences. If any of the required files are not in the repository, the information message will be shown.</p>
</div>
<div id="extracting-chromatograms-for-the-selected-feature" class="section level3">
<h3>Extracting chromatograms for the selected feature</h3>
<p>Highlight the feature in the table, right-click to show the context menu and choose “Extract XIC setup” to show the dialog.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.113.png" /></p>
<p>The “Define chromatograms” panel will be populated with all currently opened data files and the source file for selected MSMS features will be highlighted. M/Z for the most intensive peak in the MSMS will be placed in the M/Z values field. Other fields in the form will be populated with the last used values.</p>
<p>“Select masses for extraction” panel will have a list of all peaks in MSMS (intensity of 999 corresponds to parent ion and is not a measured value unless by a very rare chance a real peak has intensity of exactly 999). You may select any combination of M/Z values and send them to the “M/Z values” field by clicking the “Add masses to extract” button at the bottom.</p>
<p>Click the “Extract chromatogram” button to run the process. Once XICs are extracted the software will switch to the “Raw data” panel.</p>

<div id="table-layout-manager-manual" class="section level3">
<h3>Table layout manager manual</h3>
<p>Some of the ID tracker tables contain a large number of columns which makes it difficult to see the necessary data and in different workflows the most suitable subset of columns, relative column order and line sorting order may be different. This manual describes how to customize these parameters.</p>
<p>To call table customization dialog right-click on the table header and select “Show table preferences” near the bottom of the context popup menu (<em>454</em>).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.114.png" /></p>
<p>54.54 <em>Table header popup menu</em></p>
<p>The table customization dialog has two parts (<em>455</em>). The upper part contains all the columns in the current order. All hidden columns are listed at the end. To enable or disable the column check/uncheck the corresponding box in the “Visible” column.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.115.png" /></p>
<p>55.55 <em>Table customization dialog</em></p>
<p>It is now possible to sort the tables by multiple columns (Excel-like). To add the column to the sorter select it in the upper list, right-click and choose “Add column to sorter” from the context menu. The selected column will appear at the end of the sorter list below with ascending sort direction by default. You may change the direction of the sorting by selecting the necessary value in the “Sort order” column (<em>456</em>).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.116.png" /></p>
<p>56.56 <em>Changing sort order</em></p>
<p>To change sorting priority, select the sorter in the list, right-click and select “Increase sort priority to move sorter up, or”Decrease …” to move it down. Select “Remove column from sorter” to stop sorting by the values in this column (<em>457</em>).</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/5bf92be9f759.117.png" /></p>
<p>57.57 <em>Changing sort priority.</em></p>
<p>Click “Apply” to apply the changes to the table. The changes will be saved, and the new layout will be used the next time you start the software. It also applies to the order of the columns. To reorder columns click and drag the column header to the new position (this operation is disabled on some tables, so the column order remains constant).</p>
